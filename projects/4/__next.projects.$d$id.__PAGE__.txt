I led the full creative direction, from concept and moodboard development to shoot styling, art direction, and editing. The campaign captured a Pinterest-inspired, filmy sleepover vibe, warm lighting, candid laughter, and intimate, relatable energy. The creative intent was to make Trigz feel like a staple at every South African girl's sleepover, blending authenticity, trend culture, and effortless fun. I used Lightroom and CapCut to edit both the photo and video content, ensuring a cohesive visual style and tone across the full social rollout."}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-4","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold","children":"Project Details"}],[["$","p","0",{"className":"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed","children":"The Girl Dinner campaign captures the essence of youthful, carefree moments.
